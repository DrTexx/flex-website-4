# Gone Dark
On the 8th of January 2021 shortly after the removal of @realDonaldTrump from twitter, the Flex Dapps website was unreachable for exactly 8 minutes 22 seconds. When it reappeared it was hashed and compared to a prior instance by a community forensic unit, the hashes were a match. It was officially declared that the site and its contents hard not been tampered with.

--

Since the site outage numerous associates of the community reported that content on the site did not match what they remembered to be true in the years prior. Examples of these include the X-Cessive Overlord having no beard, that the original Flex office had been in a butter factory or that the Violent Artist was infact the name of a classified operation involving cranes, rather than a person. In an industry analysis performed by the RMIT Blockchain Innovation Hub it was this was named a crypto-psychological case of the Mandela Effect or [‚ÄúFalse Memory‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_memory#:~:text=In%202010%2C%20this%20shared%20false,having%20served%20as%20President%20of) likely to occur in DAOs. Stories detailing the gang‚Äôs discovery of a multi-verse and subsequent disappearance into other timelines were also been popularised by members of Q-anon on forums such as 4chan /biz/ and the WeWork community message boards.

In late 2021 Blockchain Australia commissioned a working group to invetigate whereabouts of the Australias infamous team of web3 avengers. In the early weeks of January 2022 when the working group were officially scheduled to report their findings, the CEO of Blockchain Australia resigned. To this day the investigation's findings remain classified.
